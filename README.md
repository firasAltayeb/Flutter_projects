# Mini_flutter_projects

A number of miscellaneous projects that are not polished/ready enough for the Apple/Google app stores. 

## Quiz App 

This project is a simple quiz game where users have to answer 48 questions to win. Users get four attempts (represented by hearts). Answering a question correctly or incorrectly plays a corresponding audio clip. This project incorporates state management with Riverpod and the audioplayers packages.

## Personal Keep 

This project is a simple expense tracker. Users can add items to the track, which will be reflected in the top section chart. This project supports both orientation (landscape & portrait) and platform-appropriate widgets (FloatingActionButton for Android).
